### ***Aim*** : Stack Implementation
### ***Algorithm*** :

Stack Operations:

Push:
Add an element to the top of the stack.
If the stack is full, display an error message (stack overflow).

Pop:
Remove the element from the top of the stack.
If the stack is empty, display an error message (stack underflow).

Display:
Show all elements in the stack from the bottom to the top.
If the stack is empty, indicate that it's empty.

Peek:
View the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
If the stack is empty, indicate that it's empty.

Exit:
End the program.

Stack Implementation:
The stack is implemented using an array and a variable (top) that keeps track of the top element's position.
isFull checks if the stack is full, and isEmpty checks if it's empty.
push adds an element to the top of the stack if it's not full.
pop removes the top element if the stack is not empty.
display shows all elements if the stack is not empty.
peek shows the top element without removing it if the stack is not empty.

Menu:
The program displays a menu with options for push, pop, display, peek, and exit.
It prompts the user to enter their choice and performs the corresponding operation.
If an invalid choice is entered, it displays an error message.

Main Loop:
The program continues to execute until the user chooses to exit.
It repeats the menu and operation execution based on the user's input.

This program allows users to interact with a stack, performing operations like adding, removing, displaying, and peeking at elements. It provides a user-friendly interface through a menu.

### ***Explanation*** :

What is a Stack?
Think of a stack like a stack of books. You can add a new book on top or take the top book away. The last book you put on is the first one you take off.

Operations:

Push:
Imagine adding a new book to the top of the stack. That's pushing. If your stack is full (too many books), you can't add more.

Pop:
Picture taking the top book off the stack. That's popping. If your stack is empty (no books), you can't take any off.

Display:
If you want to see all your books, you can display them. If there are no books, you just say there are none.

Peek:
Suppose you want to see the top book without taking it off. That's peeking. If there are no books, you can't peek.

Exit:
When you're done playing with your stack, you can say, "I'm done," and exit.

How It Works:
Your books are like numbers in a computer.
The computer can add a new number on top (push) or take the top number away (pop).
If there are too many numbers, you can't add more (overflow). If there are no numbers, you can't take any away (underflow).
You can also see all the numbers (display) or look at the top one without taking it off (peek).

Menu:
The computer asks you, "What do you want to do?"
You can say, "Add a number on top" (push), "Take the top number away" (pop), "Show me all the numbers" (display), "Show me the top number without taking it away" (peek), or "I'm done" (exit).

Keep Going Until Done:
You can keep doing these things until you say, "I'm done."
If you try something weird (like telling the computer to do something it doesn't understand), it will tell you it doesn't get it and ask again.

So, it's like playing with a stack of books, but the books are numbers, and the computer helps you do things with them.
